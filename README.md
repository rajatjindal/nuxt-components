# Nuxt Components

Reusable Nuxt Components. Help building the basic CRUD operations using UI faster.

## Story



A few years back, a friend of mine asked for some help to implement a project for him. It was during lockdown. I started learning NuxtJS for that. First few implementations were horrible, but I was making some progress on learning how to write reusable code to help me iterate faster.

This library is the collection of such components/composables/sdk.

## Usage

Add following lines to your `nuxt.config.ts` file:

```
extends: [
  'github:rajatjindal/nuxt-components'
],
```

and you are all set to use these components.

TODO: add more documentation and examples

> :warning: **Warning**
>
> - I am pretty new to Nuxt and mainly using these components in hobby projects. Please use at your own risk.
> - These components are customized to my needs. and I will most likely continue to make changes as per my requirements. So I won't commit to any backward compatibility promises.
